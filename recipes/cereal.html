    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 25rem">Nothing really hits like a well timed bowl of Cereal. If you are anything like me you can eat truck loads of the stuff. Here is how I like to prepare my Cereal! </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cereal</li>
        <li>Cereal Bowl</li>
        <li>Milk or milk alternative</li>
        <li>Spoon</li>

    </ul>
    <ol style="max-width: 25rem">
        <li>Grab a box of cereal. reach for whichever one speaks out to you! No need to worry about calories of any of that stuff (unless you have a medical condition). I prefer Chocolate Frosted Flakes.</li>
        <li>Pour out the cereal into your bowl. I like to leave about 1/8 of rim so the milk doesn't cause it to spill over.</li>
        <li> Next, grab your favorite milk or milk alternative. Begin to pour untill the cereal rises to the brim of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Lastly. gently place the spoon into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
