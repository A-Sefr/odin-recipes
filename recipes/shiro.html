    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 25rem">My family is Ethiopian Orthodox and in that tradition there are periods where you are supposed to abstain from eating animal products (essentially fasting). So, we ended up eating a lot of Shiro Wat. It is really easy to prepare,  vegan and gluten-free, and hearty. Check it out! </p>
